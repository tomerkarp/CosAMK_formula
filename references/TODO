Todo:
  ✔ add message log canbus arbitration implementation @done(24-09-13 19:24)
  ✔ not selecting comm ports permanently @done(24-09-13 18:19)
  ☐ if comm port is not selected or not working for canbus communication, don't allow enabling communication (Harder than I thought)
  ☐ unit test with stm32 microcontroller the canbus communication
  ☐ not setting all leds to red when canbus communication is not working
  ☐ when disabling canbus communication, after cant enable it again 
  ☐ motor speed, torque, setpooints are not working
